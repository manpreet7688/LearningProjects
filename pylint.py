'''As you begin to expand to larger multi -file projects it becomes important to have tests in place.
This way as you make changes or update your code, you can run your test files to make sure previous code  still
runs as expected.
There are several testing tools, we will focus on two:
1. pylint: This is a library that looks at your code and reports back possible issues.
2. unittest: This built in library will allow to test your own programs and check you are getting desired outputs.
We will begin by showing you how to use pylint to check your code for possible errors and styling.
Python as a set of style convention rules known as "PEP 8"
Afterwards we will explore how to test our code  with the built in unittest library'''
